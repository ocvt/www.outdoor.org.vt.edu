				 <h3 class="smallHeader">Description</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing is free, guests/walk-ins are welcome, and the LCaT will provide all equipment. All our games are played in the woods. As there is always the risk of poison ivy, ticks, thorns, mud, etc., pants and appropriate footwear are recommended and playing is at your own risk. You will need to bring your own water and food. Have a great week and we hope to see you there.<br />
<br />
COVID RULES: All CDC guidelines for outdoor activities must be followed. Unless in the same house/apartment, all players MUST keep minimum 10 foot distances from one another at all times (Was already an in game rule before COVID). Any closer requires a facemask with a minimum 6 foot distance. Equipment is sanitized before and after every game. Note that unless there is an equipment failure, a player will need to stick with the tagger they select for the event.</p><br> <h3 class="smallHeader">Driving Directions</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get Google Map directions at https://goo.gl/maps/gSGZVd16D8C2 which shows where we start our games (next to the parking lot near the pond. Look for our VT colored LCAT sign). Due to COVID, we will not be able to provide any carpool rides.</p><br> <h3 class="smallHeader">Trip Difficulty</h3> - <span style="color:orange">Moderate</span><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Games involve splitting up into teams and walking/running through the woods with goals from simply eliminating enemy teams to capturing a team's flag or taking the hill.</p><br> <h3 class="smallHeader">What You Should Bring</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to bring WATER! All our games are played in the woods. As there is always the risk of poison ivy, ticks, thorns, mud, etc., pants and appropriate footwear are recommended (many players tend to wear camouflage. Natural colors can be helpful) and playing is at your own risk. The Laser Tag Club at Virginia Tech will provide all game equipment.</p><br><h3 class="smallHeader">Send Message to Trip Leader</h3><h3>You must be logged in to use this feature.</h3><hr></div></div><!--end content-->
